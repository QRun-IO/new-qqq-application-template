# Issue Guidance for the Template

This repository is a starter template for building your own QQQ-based application.

**Where to file issues**
- Template bugs or improvements: open an issue in this repository.
- QQQ framework problems: https://github.com/Kingsrook/qqq/issues
- Your cloned app’s features/bugs: adjust or remove this template file in your own repo.

**Include when reporting**
1) What you expected vs. saw  
2) Steps to reproduce (commands, env vars)  
3) Environment (OS, Java, database)  
4) Logs or stack traces if available

Thanks for helping keep the template clean and usable for others.
