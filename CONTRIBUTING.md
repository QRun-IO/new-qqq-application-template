# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve the QQQ application template. This template is designed to be cloned and customized for apps outside the QRun/QQQ org. Please keep contributions lightweight and template-friendly.

## Guidelines
- Follow the QQQ contributing guidance: https://github.com/Kingsrook/qqq/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md
- Use conventional commits (e.g., `chore(template): ...`, `fix(template): ...`).
- Keep template defaults generic; avoid org-specific values.
- Add tests (`mvn test`) for logic changes.
- Run `mvn clean package` to ensure the template still builds out of the box.

If you customize this template for your own project, replace this file with your local contribution process.
